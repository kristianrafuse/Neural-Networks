Neural-Networks
-------
In the example, I use Google Colab, TensorFlow, KerasTuner, scikit-learn libraries to create a binary classifier that can predict whether funding applicants will be successful. It uses a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received and the status of their application. 

Highlights: 
-------
* Using Pandas and scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler(), I preprocess the dataset.
* Split the preprocessed data into a features array, X, and a target array, y. Use these arrays and the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing datasets.
* Scale the training and testing features datasets by creating a StandardScaler instance, fitting it to the training data, then using the transform function.


Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model:
-------
* Create a neural network model by assigning the number of input features and nodes for each layer using TensorFlow and Keras.
* Create the first hidden layer and choose an appropriate activation function.
* Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.
* Compile and train the model.
* Create a callback that saves the model's weights every five epochs.
* Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy.
